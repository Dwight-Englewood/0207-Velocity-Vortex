/*
 *
 * This is an example LinearOpMode that shows how to use
 * the Adafruit RGB Sensor.  It assumes that the I2C
 * cable for the sensor is connected to an I2C port on the
 * Core Device Interface Module.
 *
 * It also assuems that the LED pin of the sensor is connected
 * to the digital signal pin of a digital port on the
 * Core Device Interface Module.
 *
 * You can use the digital port to turn the sensor's onboard
 * LED on or off.
 *
 * The op mode assumes that the Core Device Interface Module
 * is configured with a name of "dim" and that the Adafruit color sensor
 * is configured as an I2C device with a name of "color".
 *
 * It also assumes that the LED pin of the RGB sensor
 * is connected to the signal pin of digital port #5 (zero indexed)
 * of the Core Device Interface Module.
 *
 * You can use the X button on gamepad1 to toggle the LED on and off.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
